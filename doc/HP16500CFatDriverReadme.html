<h1 style="text-align: center;">HP16500C Linux Fat Driver Readme</h1>
This driver is really very easy, and shouldn't mess up existing systems. <br>
<br>
It looks for 'HP16500' in the FAT table, then modifies parameters in
that table to match a 512 sector size, which most sane FATs should
already have.<br>
<br>
So even if this new code is triggered, it should be a NOP.<br>
<br>
Get the tarball here:<br>
<a href="hdd_driver.tar.bz2">hdd_driver.tar.bz2</a><br>
Untar the tarball then go to that directory and type 'make'. You will
need the Linux headers installed for your running kernel. If you use a
debian package system, then use this commandto install them:<br>
<br>
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)<br>
<br>
Once that is done, go to the directory where the driver is installed and type make.<br>
<br>
Then, make sure all FAT file systems are unmounted (you will get an error until they are unmounted) then type:<br>
<br>
sudo rmmod vfat fat<br>
sudo insmod fat.ko<br>
sudo insmod vfat.ko<br>
<br>
Your new modules should be running.<br>
<br>
Now you can mount that HP drive. I'm looking into doing the byteswap in the kernel as well, but that's really wacked.<br>

Let me know if it's not working. gpib at rickyrockrat&nbsp; net.<br>
