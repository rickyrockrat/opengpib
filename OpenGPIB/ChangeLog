2010-01-17 RickyRockRat V_0_0_2: prepare to move the hp16500 parser to a lib so it 
can be integrated with the rest of the system. Also prepare to add the la2vcd lib.
2010-01-17 RickyRockRat V_0_0_3: Moved parser to the new hp16500 library.
Integrated la2vcd lib into parse_16500_config.
2010-01-19 RickyRockRat V_0_0_5: Added la2vcd to get_hp_16555_waveform. 
Implemented a dist target and VERSION for imbedding into the build.
2010-01-19 RickyRockRat V_0_0_6: Left out significant files from CVS...Bad
rev.
2010-01-19 RickyRockRat V_0_0_7: Added internet driver for HP, printf->
fprintf clean up.
2010-01-19 RickyRockRat V_0_0_8: Added -r (set sample rate,trigger) and
changed sec/div in waveform menu to get trace back soonest. Added setting of
polarity bit, since it *does* invert the data. Still need to revert the data
back to raw using this info.
2010-01-24 RickyRockRat V_0_0_9: Added more reverse engineering for the config
info, which really only effects the hp16500 config parser.

2012-04-26 RickyRockRat V_0_1_1 Added fileio interface (fileio.c/h), added get_hp_plot, bcomon, 
hp_16655_to_vcd, plot_file, and setup_16532. Renamed get_hp_16530_waveform.c to
get_hp_1653xx_scope.c. Added is_string_number in common.c/h. 

Added struct hp_cardlist, get hp_info_card, print_card_model, select_hp_card,
show_known_hp_cards, hp16500_find_card, show_hp_connection_info,
show_common_usage, handle_common_opts, usage, main, parse_options, 
set_channel_offset, set_channel_ranged, get_trigger_source, get_xinc_mult,
oscope_parse_preamble, check_oscope_channel, oscope_get_preamble, 
get_oscope_data, validate_sampleperiod, and config_show_label to hp16500.c.

Fixed having both analizers on in config_show_label. Most of these functions
were moved here from the get_hp_1653xx_scope.c and get_hp_16555_waveform.c,
so that we could use these common functions between different cards.

Added fileio to gpib.c as a machine time, intended to process raw data and
added the function init_id, which generically sends an id string. 

Added ability to specify the signal type (la2vcd_lib API change) in 
parse_16500_config.c, tek2gplot.c, and get_hp_1653xx_scope.c. 

Added ability to extract and extrapolate the data from '32 and '34 scope
cards at the same time. The '32 is 1/2 the data len of the '34, so it 
(depending on delay, which is not yet implemented) misses the beginning
and end 1/4 of the trace.  

see README for examples on get/set both settings/data on the 16500C and 
the '32/'34 scope cards.
