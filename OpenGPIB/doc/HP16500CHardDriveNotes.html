The HP 16500C has a very&nbsp; interesting HDD.&nbsp; It is MS-Dos
Fat16, with some twists.<br>

<br>

1) They are byte-swapped meaning every byte has to be swapped before
reading/writing on a intel machine (and any Linux machine)<br>

2) The bytes per sector is set to 32768 (for the 1.6G hdd).<br>

3) There is no partiton table. Instead, the drive appears as a single
partition.&nbsp; <br>

<br>

There is hope, however. Here is how you can extract and save the data.
This all happens on a Linux box. Sorry, windows users, get a real OS.
:) <br>

<br>

<h2>Introduction to Linux</h2>

On Windows you have C: D:&nbsp; until you run out of drive letters, and
I don't know what the raw device access looks like. Not even sure a
non-developer can access it.<br>

<br>

On Linux, which is a form a Unix, life is much easier for these sorts
of things. Free compilers, free source code, and best of all an OS that
makes sense and isn't out to take over the world. <br>

<br>

Drives are mounted somewhere on the file system, and the mother of them
all is root, accessed with a /.&nbsp; Just change C: to / and you've
got a good start.&nbsp; Since they are not drive letters anymore, how
do you find your drives and use them?&nbsp; Well, they are all mounted
under root.&nbsp; Many Linux systems choose to mount removable media
under /media, and some will show up under /media/Lexar128M or some
other name.&nbsp; The F: drive (or whatever Windows chose to call it)
is equivalent to /media/Lexar128M. <br>

<br>

One more thing, Linux is case sensitive, so <span style="color: rgb(92, 67, 216);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">H</span>elp</span>
and <span style="color: rgb(51, 204, 255);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">h</span>elp</span> are not the same. <br>

<br>

The other wonderful thing about Linux is that you can access a disk
image (i.e. a file that contains all the bytes from your hard drive).
This includes iso images, floppy images, etc. -- Even if Linux doesn't
recognize it.<br>

<br>

One further cool idea that Unix has is that everything is a file. You
want to print to a screen? It's a file. You want to write to your
monitor? It's a file. You want to write to your hard drive? You guessed
it, file.&nbsp; Everything is done with open, read, write, close, and
just for those cases you want to circumvent anything, there's ioctl.<br>

<br>

On Linux there is something called a loopback device, and it allows you
to present a file as a block device (which is what hard drives are).
You can do all kinds of horrible things to the block device but not
actually write any data to the hard drive. It also allows you to save
your drive so if you completly screw it up you can get it back.<br>

<br>

The raw disk devices are either hdx or sdx, where x is replaced by a
consecutive run of letters (sorta like Windows), however the drive is
accesed in a logical manner.<br>

<br>

Let's use sdb as an example. /dev/sdb is the whole drive. /dev/sdb1 is
the first partition and so on. In Windows you would never have access
to /dev/sdb.<br>

<br>

<h2>Dump the Hard Drive</h2>

This section assumes you have and IDE adapter and/or a CF to IDE
adapter if you are using a compact flash - and more importantly, know
how to hook it up properly.<br>

<br>

There is a nice utility called dd (dump data, I believe) and that's
what it does (dumps data, that is).<br>

<br>

First, dd the data from the device while byte swapping it:<br>

<br>

<ol>

  <li><span style="color: black;">First,
dd the data from the device while byte swapping it:</span> <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">dd
if=/dev/sdb of=hp16500bs.img conv=swab</span></li>
  <li>Remove the current Linux fat drivers (called modules). This means
you will have to unmount all file systems using FAT: <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">sudo rmmod vfat fat</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>Modify the Linux fat driver found in fs/fat/inode.c in the Linux
source, or use my build. That's a separate discussion for another page (<a href="HP16500CFatDriverReadme.html" target="_blank">Look Here</a>).</li>
  <li>Install the driver (covered in 3): <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">sudo insmod fat; sudo insmod vfat</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>Create the mount point: <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">mkdir
hp</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>Mount the driver: <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">sudo
mount -o loop p16500bs.img hp</span>.</li>
  <li>Make the destination directory: <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">mkdir hp.sav</span></li>
  <li>Copy the files from the image: <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">cp -r hp/* hp.sav</span></li>
  <li>Unmount the drive: <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">sudo
umount hp</span></li>
</ol>

If you want to create a backup copy of your drive, use this:<br>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">dd if=/dev/sdb of=hp16500bs.img</span><br>
<br>
To create a backup copy of just the MBR, use this:<br>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">dd if=/dev/sdb of=Memorex128M.mbr bs=512 count=1</span><br>
<br>

If you want to put that image back on the drive, do this:<br>

<span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">dd if=/dev/sdb of=hp16500bs.img
conv=swab</span><br>

Notice the conv=swab - that byteswaps all of the bytes on the drive
while it's copying. Pretty nifty if you ask me.<br>

<br>

<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">
To zero the first 10k bytes:</span><br style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1024 count=10</span><br>

<br>

On the 256M Simple Tech CF, I did just these steps - it's quite fast
and it does work.<br>

<br>

1) Format on 16500C<br>

2) <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">dd if=/dev/sdb of=hp16500bs.img conv=swab</span><br>

3) <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">mount -o loop hp16500bs.img mnt</span><br>

4) Copy all system files to mnt/SYSTEM, and any setup files to mnt<br>

5) umount mnt<br>

6) <span style="color: rgb(0, 146, 0);">dd if=hp16500bs.img of=/dev/sdb conv=swab<br>
<br>
<span style="color: black;">A *VERY* interesting effect is that none of these cards worked with the USB-IDE adapter I used with the CF-IDE adapter.<br>
They would timeout and give disk errors.&nbsp; The Simple Tech card had
no problems, so I suspect that if it works with a USB-IDE adapter it
will work on the HP.<br>
</span></span>

<br>

This much is working, but I don't know if the kernel developers will
like my patch to the fat driver.<br>

<br>

I have a plan to build a new working image from that file dump. It goes
something like this:<br>

<ol>

  <li>Format the new device using FAT16 (HDD/Compact Flash).</li>
  <li>dump the data to a file, so there's an image of that format.</li>
  <li>Mount the image and copy all the files from the old drive, or
from the floppies.</li>
  <li>Unmount the image.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Write a simple program that morks the FAT boot block so it fits
HP's wackiness.</li>
  <li>Run said program on image.</li>
  <li>dd the image back to the device and byte swap at the same time.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Compact Flash Tested<br>
</h2>

It seems there are more that don't work than do.&nbsp; I tried these:<br>

<br>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

that directory is /system/disk/hard/system.&nbsp; But I never did get
all the files copied successfully via FTP.&nbsp; Instead, I mounted the
the byte-swapped CF flash image copied the files over, then copied the
file back using dd and swab.<br>

Most any of the SimpleTech HDDs should work. I have 64/128/256M that work. They look like this:<br>
<a href="SimpleTech64MZeroed.img.bs.bz2"><img style="border: 2px solid ; width: 234px; height: 200px;" alt="SimpleTech256M" src="SimpleTech256-sm.jpg"></a><br>
<br>
Here is a 64M image that can be used to test any media (Click the image
above). This is a byte swapped image so that it can be read on a x86
machine. This has the latest software (V1.09) already on it. You create
the Hard Drive using this command (after bunzip2 ing it):<br>
<pre wrap="">dd if=SimpleTech64MZeroed.img.bs of=/dev/sdx conv=swab</pre>
The /dev/sdx is the device on Linux where your CF card appears. There
are many adapters out there to adapt from CF to IDE-PATA, and from
there are USB-IDE adapters. The most useful CF to IDE-PATA is the one
that just plugs into the end of the IDE cable. You will need a Floppy
Drive power adapter to go from the standard 4-Pin PC power supply to
the floppy connector found on most of these CF-IDE adapters.<br>
<br>
I just received an email from Alexandre Becoulet on using mtools to
access the HDD (which, if it works, is MUCH preferrable to kernel
module hacking described above):<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">I found a new way to access the FAT16 with non-standard sector</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">size which does not involve kernel hacking. Here is what I found:</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">The GNU mtools have support for non standard sector size.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">The sector size is limited to 8192 bytes however. You have</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">to change this constant before building the mtools package:</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">./msdos.h:#define
MAX_SECTOR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
32768&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*
largest sector size */</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Then you can access the byte swapped image using your custom built mtools:</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">./mdir -i /tmp/hp16500bs.img</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">./mcopy -o -i /tmp/hp16500bs.img /tmp/PVTEST/* ::SYSTEM</span><br>
