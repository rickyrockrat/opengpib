<p>This is a working project, i.e. the author updates the project
when some new work take him down a dark, mysterious path requiring some
new code to implement a new feature.</p>
This is using several prologix controllers (USB), and interfaces with
the following instruments:<br>
<ul>
<li>HP 8595E (Spectrum Analyzer)</li>
<li>HP 16500A/B/C (Logic Analyzer). <a target="_blank" href="HP16500CNotes.html">Reverse-engineering notes</a> and <a href="HP16500CHardDriveNotes.html" target="_blank">HDD notes</a>.</li>
<li>HP 16531 (6bit dual channel, 400MS/s, 100Mhz bw)</li>
<li>HP 16555A (64 channel, 110Mhz state/500Mhz timing 1M/pod
Analyzer)</li>
<li>Wayne Kerr PSG2400L (2Ghz signal Generator)</li>
<li>Tek 2440 (Dual channel, 500MS/s scope)</li>
</ul>
Using the Spectrum Analyzer and the Signal generator, a network
analyzer of sorts can be built. &nbsp;This functionality is
provided by the network analyzer code. &nbsp;Gain can be measured
over frequency. There is a cal mode that measures the loss and
frequency of the cable (or signal generator). The compensation using
that cal is not complete yet.<br>
<br>
The 16555 code will extract the data and configuration from the
analyzer. There is a parser that parses both of these data structures.
&nbsp;I never found full docs for the config data, so I reverse
engineered it to find out which label goes with which bit(s).&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
I also recently added code that will interface with the 16534/16532
2/1GS/s scope cards. I have two each of these and wrote the code to
syncronize the data from them and generates plots via GNU plot.<br><br>This parser also generates a file compatible with la2vcd.
&nbsp;The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opengpib/files/la2vcd/la2vcd-0.02.tar.gz/download">0.02</a> version of la2vcd contains a couple fatal bugs, so
I've included a fixed version <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opengpib/files/la2vcd/la2vcd-0.02F.tar.gz/download"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">la2vcd-0.02F.tar.gz</span></a>.
&nbsp;This is the <a href="http://www.brouhaha.com/%7Eeric/software/la2vcd/" target="_blank">la2vcd web page</a>, and the <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/la2vcd/" target="_blank">freshmeat</a> page of the same. &nbsp;Here is an <a href="full16ns.la2vcd" target="_blank">example</a> of how to split traces using the la2vcd. <br><br>There is a new version of la2vcd that has the bugs fixed <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> has been converted&nbsp;to a library by rickyrockrat. Version 0.02L6 is here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opengpib/files/la2vcd/la2vcd-0.02L6.tar.gz/download">la2vcd-0.02L6.tar.gz</a>&nbsp; It is a little clunky, but it does work. The 16555A code now dumps directly to a vcd file.<br>
<br>
Waveform viewers that work well with the vcd format are <a target="_blank" href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/">GTKWave</a> and <a href="http://www.veripool.org/wiki/dinotrace" target="_blank">Dinotrace</a>, but&nbsp;the latter has not been tested.<br>
<br>
The 16531 and 2440 code pulls waveforms off of the each instrument and
will generate gnuplot files so the data can be viewed vi gnuplot, or
generates png images. Here is one screenshot:<br>

There are also notes and fonts to get the remote X-window control to work on Linux here:<br>
