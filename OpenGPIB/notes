Voltage=(point value - YOFF)*YMULT

    The 2440 has an A-D converter that always resolves waveforms to 1/25 of
1 vertical division. This means waveforms are displayed on the instrument
screen with a vertical resolution of 25 values (also called digitizing levels) per
division. The total number of values available for making waveform
measurements is the vertical window size and is different for different ranges of
acquisition rate settings. It is always greater than the 8 division available on
screen, and varies from a minimum of 226 values (9 divisions) to a maximum of
256 values (10.24 divisions). (See Vertical Window for Making
Measurementsn in Section 3 of this guide for a discussion of vertical windows.

There are always 1024 points.... XINCR is the time interval between points

This should return the Scope ID.

To obtain the waveform from the scope, use these commands:
First, find the GPIB address by pressing the output (2440), then setup->Addr.
Next open up minicom to the instrument ttyUSBx,(usually ttyUSB0), then type 
++ver
This should print this string:
Prologix GPIB-USB Controller version 5.0
Then set to Controller mode
++mode 1
Set the address to talk to (2, usually)
++addr 2
Set the eoi mode (EOI after cmd)
++eoi 1
Set the eos mode (LF)
++eos 2
Then communicate with the scope.
DATA SOURCE: REF1-4 CH1-2
DATA ENCDG:ASCI
WAV?
++read

DATA SOURCE:CH2
To grab a waveform, set the data source, then download it. If ++auto is not set, then 
DATA SOURCE:CH1
wav?


To get the cursor info, just type
cursor?
The return string is something like:
CURSOR FUNCTION:VOLTS,TARGET:CH1,UNITS:TIME:BASE,UNITS:SLOPE:BASE,UNITS:VOLTS:BA
SE,REFVOLTS:UNITS:V,REFVOLTS:VALUE:1.0000,REFSLOPE:XUNIT:SEC,REFSLOPE:YUNIT:V,RE

O:-3.00,YPOS:ONE:2.47,YPOS:TWO:1.38,TPOS:ONE:1.24000E+2,TPOS:TWO:1.95500E+2,MODE
:DELTA,SELECT:TWO
Then look for function (VOLTS or?) target (CH1)
Send the command to read target: 
ch1?
Data looks like:
CH1 VOLTS:5E-1,VARIABLE:0,POSITION:-3.15,COUPLING:DC,FIFTY:OFF,INVERT:OFF

Then you take the YPOS:ONE and YPOS:TWO and subtract, then multiply by the CH1 VOLTS: value.
This example gives you 545 mV.

use this to figure out which channel(s) are on.
vmode?
Data:
VMODE CH1:ON,CH2:ON,ADD:OFF,MULT:OFF,DISPLAY:YT

To find out info on the trigger(s), use ATRIGGER?
Data:
ATRIGGER MODE:SGLSEQ,SOURCE:CH1,COUPLING:DC,LOGSRC:OFF,LEVEL:2.04,SLOPE:PLUS,POSITION:8,HOLDOFF:0,ABSELECT:A
