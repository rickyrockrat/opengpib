Voltage=(point value - YOFF)*YMULT

    The 2440 has an A-D converter that always resolves waveforms to 1/25 of
1 vertical division. This means waveforms are displayed on the instrument
screen with a vertical resolution of 25 values (also called digitizing levels) per
division. The total number of values available for making waveform
measurements is the vertical window size and is different for different ranges of
acquisition rate settings. It is always greater than the 8 division available on
screen, and varies from a minimum of 226 values (9 divisions) to a maximum of
256 values (10.24 divisions). (See Vertical Window for Making
Measurementsn in Section 3 of this guide for a discussion of vertical windows.

There are always 1024 points.... XINCR is the time interval between points
